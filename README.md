# First steps: 

- Generate 2D Grid of Hits:
	- Want 2D grid (arrays?) of floats: 10x10 grid, {1=hit, 0=no hit}
	- After that, move to values between 0 and 1 for each hit to represent a distributions
- Using that grid (arrays or vectors), we can start making a clustering algorithm

- Visualize it with matplotlib or some other tool
